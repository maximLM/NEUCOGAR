# NeuCogAr (Neuromodulating Cognitive Architecture)

## Overview

The project to validate the 3D model of emotions based on LÃ¶vheim model of monoamine neuromodulators described on [wiki page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%B6vheim_cube_of_emotion).

Overview of the model could be found in this [seminar](https://github.com/max-talanov/1/blob/master/cognitive%20technologies%20seminars/2014-12-17%20Computational%20affective%20thinking%20model%20%20Techtalk.md#monoamines-model).

Validation is based on realistic (spiking) neural network [NEST](http://nest-initiative.org/Software:About_NEST) spiking (realistic) neural network. Analysis of realistic neural networks could be found [here](https://github.com/max-talanov/1/blob/master/computational%20emotional%20thinking%20course/realistic_nns.md).

## Developer guide

### Read experiment description

Please use following experiment description: [experiment description](experiment_description.md)

### Download NEST

Please use latest version available here: http://nest-initiative.org/Software:Download

### Install NEST

Please find installation guide here: http://nest-initiative.org/Software:Installation

### Alternative installation with Vagrant

1. Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com)
1. Copy files Vagrantfile and provision.sh from current folder
to some fresh one
1. Open terminal and cd to that folder
1. run `vagrant up`

After completion of `vagrant up` you should have running
virtual machine with Ubuntu and NEST 2.6.0 installed.

### Start experimenting with dopamine neuromodulation

Please use following files (actually manual test from NEST) to experiment with dopamine neuromodulation.

From https://github.com/development-team/4/tree/master/NEUCOGAR/nest:

- stdp_dopa_check.py
- test_stdp_dopa.py

### Task traking system

Please use trello in SCRUM way to track and implement tasks: https://trello.com/b/lnHnRkWr/neucogar
