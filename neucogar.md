# NeuCogAr (Neuromodulating Cognitive Architecture)

## Overview

The project to validate the 3D model of emotions based on LÃ¶vheim model of monoamine neuromodulators described on [wiki page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%B6vheim_cube_of_emotion).

Overview of the model could be found in this [seminar](https://github.com/max-talanov/1/blob/master/cognitive_technologies_seminars/2014-12-17%20Computational%20affective%20thinking%20model%20%20Techtalk.md#monoamines-model).

For validation purposes we use Neurosimulator [NEST](http://www.nest-simulator.org/)
